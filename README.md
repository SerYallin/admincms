# Admin CMS

This project is for testing with admin CMS based on NestJS for the backend and Next.js for the frontend part.
The main idea is studying how to make a CMS with a simple admin panel and REST API for sharing data to the frontend part or another application like mobile or web app. The front-end part will be based on Next.js framework with fetching data from the backend.

This project is for studying only and not for contributing. Please don't use it in real projects because it could have many issues and have no support.
